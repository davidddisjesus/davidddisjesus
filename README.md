## David W.

I'm David, a student at [PHHS](https://phhs.hcps.us/) of [Ashland, VA](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ashland,_Virginia). I'm an open source software enthusiast and here is my outlet of creativity. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JS, PowerShell, and Bash. I'm learning Python, Java, and Node.

This is just a personal account for small school and work related endeavours. If you'd like to see a more extensive portfolio, feel free to take a peek at my business account [`@QuarTheDev`](https://github.com/quarthedev/).

Check out my [website](https://bit.ly/waldropdn)!

More information and resources will be added here hopefully soon.
